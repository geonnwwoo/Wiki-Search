# Wiki Search

## Information

Wiki-Search is a computer application for searching Wikipedia articles. 

## Features I would Like to Add

I want to add a vocabulary or note function within the app, that stores the data locally on your computer. By highlighting a vocab. word, I would like it to be stored inside of the user's computer locally, and for the user to access the private notes within the app.
